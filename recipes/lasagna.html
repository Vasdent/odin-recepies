    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To avoid watery lasagna, make sure your lasagna noodles are drained properly before layering. Once they are cooked and drained, do not rinse with water but immediately place in a single layer on a lightly oiled tray. </p>
    <p>
        Not rinsing in water will allow the sauce to cling to the starches on the noodle. If using cottage cheese, drain it for an hour or so before using. Simmer the sauce for at least 30 minutes uncovered to allow excess water to evaporate. Also, uncover the lasagna during the last 25 minutes of baking to release any extra moisture in the pan.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>

       <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
       <li>1-1/4 pounds bulk Italian sausage</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook noodles according to package directions; drain. Meanwhile, in a Dutch oven, cook sausage, beef and onion over medium heat 8-10 minutes or until meat is no longer pink, breaking up meat into crumbles. Add garlic; cook 1 minute. Drain.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomatoes, tomato paste, water, sugar, 3 tablespoons parsley, basil, fennel, 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, mix egg, ricotta cheese and remaining 1/4 cup parsley and 1/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°. Spread 2 cups meat sauce into an ungreased 13x9-in. baking dish. Layer with 3 noodles and a third of the ricotta mixture. Sprinkle with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers twice. Top with remaining meat sauce and cheeses (dish will be full).</li>
        <li>Bake, covered, 25 minutes. Bake, uncovered, 25 minutes longer or until bubbly. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.</li>
